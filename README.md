# DengAI

Work in Progress : 

Dengue RF attempts to run a Random Forest to predict the spread of dengue. Without any significant processing and/or feature engineering,
I am able to attain a decent MAE of 26.6298, which is slightly worse than the baseline score that uses more sophisticated methods for time
series analysis. 

I will continue to use more sophisticated techniques including pre and post-processing methods, to determine if the random forest model can 
deal with the time series component. 

Otherwise, I will use other models in future which can deal better with extrapolation of time.
